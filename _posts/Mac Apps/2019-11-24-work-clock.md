*It’s work time!*

You sit on your chair and faced with your computer. What next? A 40, 50, 60, or endless time reading the files or working on your video—or what exactly is the time you spend on your work. Yes, you may have a watch or something reminding your to get up every now and then, but you may not have one!

This is where this app comes in. Introducing: Work Clock. It’s simple, a clock on the screen, and you can pin it on top of your screen. Opening the app, you will see a huge clock or a Work Clock that can let you know how long you have been working.

It’s simple, but it’s effective. Want to try how powerful it is? Just get Work Clock now!
