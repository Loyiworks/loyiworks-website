Have you ever found it hard to make a choice between several options? Or have you ever been in a situation that you simply have to draw a numeral out of a number pool? Or have you ever found the need to group a number of people, but found that it is time-consuming or not efficient enough?

Well, the 'Chooser' app is designed for you then.

Inside the app, there are several modes that can be switched with the upper mode switcher.

* Random Number - The Random Number Generator
* Yes or No - The help for your wavering mind.
* Grouper ABC - The grouping machine with labels.
* Grouper 123 - The grouping machine when you have no time to input all the labels!
* Pick One! - Pick one from the list of items specified.
* Shuffler - The new function that works as its name suggests---shuffle a list that you gave it!

**Want to gain access to the splendid new features and the elegant UI designed just for your taste? Come get 'Chooser', you won't regret it!**
